#Password Manager

Overview

In today’s digital world, securing your online accounts is more critical than ever. The Password Manager is a powerful yet user-friendly Python-based tool designed to make password management seamless and secure. Whether you're safeguarding personal accounts or managing corporate credentials, this tool allows you to generate, store, and access passwords with ease, all while ensuring top-notch security through cutting-edge encryption.

Why This Password Manager?
Gone are the days of remembering dozens of passwords or relying on weak, reused credentials. Our Password Manager streamlines your online security practices, providing a robust solution that keeps your credentials safe from prying eyes and cyber threats.

Key Features
1. 🔒 Secure Password Generation
Easily create strong, random passwords tailored to your needs. Customize the password length, and choose whether to include special characters, numbers, uppercase, or lowercase letters. This feature ensures you always have a unique, hard-to-crack password at your fingertips.

2. 🔑 Encryption & Decryption
Your security is our priority. Every credential stored in the system is protected using advanced encryption algorithms like AES-256, ensuring that even if someone gains access to the storage, your data remains unreadable without the master key. Decrypt your credentials only when needed—you're in full control.

3. 🎛️ Intuitive Interface
Forget about complex setups or cumbersome apps. The Password Manager offers a simple, intuitive command-line interface that allows you to add, view, update, and manage your credentials effortlessly. It’s easy to use, even for those less familiar with technical tools.

4. 🗂️ Secure Storage
User credentials are safely encrypted and stored in an internal database or file system, protected by the master password. Say goodbye to storing sensitive data in vulnerable text files. You can sleep soundly knowing your credentials are secured.

5. 🔐 Ultimate Data Privacy
We take data privacy seriously. Only users with the master password have access to the stored credentials. All data is securely locked away, and we don’t store or share your master password. Lose it, and access is lost—total privacy, zero compromise.
